Since Streamlabs "accidentally" deleted my previous attempt at hosting a website I thought I'd might as well do it correctly.

<!--more-->

Well, pinheads and arcade enthusiasts. This is the first blog post at [DRI374.LIVE](https://dri374.live). This website is mostly a placeholder for all the URLs that points my services and other social media platforms. I will eventually blow life into the [gear](/gear) page but that was a LOT of copy that got lost at Streamlabs. :cursing_face:

To prevent further stupidity on my behalf, the website is hosted on GitHub and rendered with a well supported framework. There will be multiple copies of everything in multiple locations. So, that said, this copy will now be etched into eternity.

I'm not sure how often this blog will be updated but since it was part of the framework I might as just post the notorious "Hello World!".

Cheerz!
