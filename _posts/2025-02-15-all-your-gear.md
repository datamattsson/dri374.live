Finally some peace and quiet. The inventories for the different rigs I've built over the years now has a home.

Check the link in the navigation above, [dri374.live/gear](/gear) is now LIVE! It has all the gear and affiliate links you can imagine. It does not yet contain exact information on the 8020. I have the ambition to add more details and clarity around that in the future. There's a [changelog](/gear#changelog) at the bottom of the page that will summarize changes and updates to the page as things gets added/removed from the respective rigs.

So, what's next? Time for actual streaming has been very scant lately. The list of excuses are as long as the Nile but I'm hopeful this will change sooner rather than later. I need to get back into playing pinball, first and foremost.

I also have arcade projects stacked to the ceiling that I need to take care of. Both my XBOX360's decided to check out. My faith in those hacked up things for reliable gaming has diminished completely. I have another [MiSTerCade](https://misteraddons.com/products/mistercade), a NEO-GEO and a [Recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/recalbox-rgb-jamma/) to disperse onto my cabs and right now just debating what goes where. One of the candies is getting the monitor rotated back to YOKO, probably the NAC.

In other news, have you checked out the revamped swag front? The new and improved [swag.dri374.live](https://swag.dri374.live)!

Cheerz!
